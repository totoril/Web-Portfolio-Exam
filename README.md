# Web-Portfolio-Exam

This is a portfolio to showcase the projects I've been working on throughout the spring semester of 2024, in the course Advanced CSS at NTNU Gj√∏vik.

## The projects

The first project was focused on utilizing BEM methology and getting used to working collaboratively on GitHub, learning to resolve merge conflicts 
and make reusable code styles.

The second project focused on using several CSS and SVG -drawing and animation techniques to make a more intuitive and engaging digital poster.

In the final project we utilized the methologies and techniques we had learned, aswell as learned about sustainability and accessability on the web 
and put this together to make a scrollytelling story. 

## Result

This project was important to learn how to use HTML, CSS, SCSS, SVG and JavaScript. And from our lectures throughout this course, I feel like I can comfortably use these
languages to create meaningful projects in the future.

The results of these projects, both original and improved versions will be available at GitHub.
