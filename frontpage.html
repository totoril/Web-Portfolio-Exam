                        <p>
                            Main changes in the improved version is that I removed unnessesary elements, and grouped the elements with 
                            significant names, as well as simplified the elements in illustrator to make the elements less expensive
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the elements I transfered as SVGs into a folder named SVG in assets for more readable code. 
                            The elements i transfered were static eleents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I focused on improving the responsiveness on the page, and readability of the code.
