                <h3>BEM and Design systems</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                For this project I was in a group with Stian Buhayan Gabrielsen. He worked on the front-page screenshot, and I on the <em>login-page screenshot</em>. We collaborated on the SCSS that was the same for us both.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thoughout this assignment I learned alot about BEM and design systems. In the start it was a little difficult to see where to start with identifying the block, element and modifiers,
                and as the assignment progressed I started realizing how we could have classified the different parts in a more efficient way. </p>
            <p>
                From what I have learned, BEM is a great way to make <em>streamlined styles</em>, keeps the code tidy while working on it, and is very <em>helpful in bigger collaborative projects</em>.
                This assignment was very helpful in understanding the usage of BEM and design systems, but I realized that since we were recreating sites from a screenshot,
                this assignment was probably a bit small for showcasing a "real life" usecase for BEM. </p>
                
            <p> While implementing BEM one has to collaborate in a good way, making sure that everyone is on the same page and understands how you as a team is going to utilize it. 
                So I can see some challenges when it comes to <em>introducing newer people</em> to this way of styling, aswell as how it can be <em>timeconsuming</em> setting it up, and mapping out the different parts of the design. 
                But it is very <em>usefull in the longrun</em> when there is a bigger project with a <em>longterm goal</em> that can afford the more <em>expensive mapping</em>.

                <h3>SVGs, SVG Drawing and Animations, and CSS Drawing and Animations</h3>
            </a>
            <p>This group assignment is on spreading awareness about <em>digital sustainability</em> through making digital posters, with animated elements to create an <em>engaging web experience</em> for children.</p>
            <p>
                In this assignment Vilja Alexandra Henriksen and I worked together in a group. We devided the work in half, so Vilja was mainly working on the upper half of the
                poster, and I was mainly working on the latter half. But we collaborated and helped eachother out when we were stuck on some code.
            </p>
            <p>
                When starting out with the site of the poster, we did not think about simplifying and removing unnecessary elements of the vector graphics, and decided to implement the 
                whole poster as a SVG. This made it so we had to identify the different elements manually, so we could target and animate these. This also ended up making it a bit 
                unclear how we best could make the site responsive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In hindsight, we should have implemented the elements differently, making the code more structured and organized. We also did not add the reduced motion feature, making 
                the site less accessible.
            </p>

                <h3>Scroll- and Storytelling, Design Principles, Accessibility and User Experience</h3>
            </a>
            <p>This group assignment is on creating a <em>scrollable web project</em> that, with the use of animated elements tells a <em>compelling message</em>, centered around the <em>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</em>.</p>
            <p>
                In this assignment Kaja Emilie Berg, Sanna Sj√∏holt and I worked together in a group. We devided the story in three parts, where each part had four scenes.
                Sanna was mainly on the first part, Kaja on the second, and I was on the third part.
            </p>
            <p>
                We collaborated on the structure of the site. We had to restructure the html to make the object observer in JavaScript work properly, and ended up doing this lastly
                when we realized this problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we focused on finishing up the scrolling for the story, we didn't really focus on the accessibility of the site, but we did reduce some of the data size by
                using SVGs and reusing code that was reusable.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind, we should have made the site more sustainable and accessible.  
            </p>

                        <p>
                            For the group assignment my main contribution was mainly on the earth. I animated the eyes, as well as drew the earth-patch in the middle and placed the text
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also mapped out where the different elements were in the html code to make it easier to understand what we were working on.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Main changes in the improved version is that I removed unnessesary elements, and grouped the elements with 
                            significant names, as well as simplified the elements in illustrator to make the elements less expensive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the elements I transfered as SVGs into a folder named SVG in assets for more readable code. 
                            The elements I transfered were static elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I focused on improving the responsiveness on the page, as well as readability of the code and making the SVG's more simplified.
                            I have also added reduced motion to make some elements more user friendly and accessible, since the poster only uses animations that run continously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I am to work further on this poster, I will redo some of the elements, and add them a bit more seperate from eachother. Also focusing on keeping the 
                            poster engaging even with the reduced-motion.
                        </p>

                <h3>Scroll- and Storytelling, Design Principles, Accessability and User Experience</h3></a>
                <ul>
                        <p>
                            My main contributions on this project is pitching the main idea on the focus of frogs, and how they indicate a healthy environment,
                            some SVGs, like the frog, leafs, and logs. I was also responsible for coding, styling and scripting in the last third of the story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main changes I've done in the improved version is that I made the text more structured and cohesive throughout the story, 
                            keeping the same style of text in the same header style. For the headings I made classes grouping all the headers into their
                            designated style. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I improved the transitions between the parts of the story by making the elements fade when scrolling past the sections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I focused the most on improving the experience of scrolling through the story and making it more clear in its message by doing so.
                            To further substantiate the message of the story I changed out some elements with some that i feel are better suited, and animated some
                            additional frogs to my frames for the concistency of the story. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I ended up adding reduced motion to some of the animations, to make the site more user friendly and accessible. But since I used most
                            of the same animations and structure as in the original SCSS and HTML, I did not apply reduced-animation to nearly as much of the animation 
                            as would like. I found that the way we used animations, nested them deep within code and spread throughout several different elements. 
                            making it an induring task to simplify the styles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further work on this improved version, I would redo some of the structure, making it more efficient in adding reduced-motion to more of the site,
                            while keeping the storytelling a pleasant experience.
