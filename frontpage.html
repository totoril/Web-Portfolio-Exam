                <h3>BEM and Design systems</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Thoughout this assignment I learned alot about BEM and design systems. In the start it was a little difficult to see where to start with identifying the block, element and modifiers,
                and as the assignment progressed I started realizing how we could have classified the different parts in a more efficient way. </p>
            <p>
                From what I have learned, BEM is a great way to make streamlined styles, keeps the code tidy while working on it, and is very helpful in bigger collaborative projects.
                This assignment was very helpful in understanding the usage of BEM and design systems, but I realized that since we were recreating sites from a screenshot,
                this assignment was probably a bit small for showcasing a "real life" usecase for BEM. </p>
                
            <p> While implementing BEM one has to collaborate in a good way, making sure that everyone is on the same page and understands how you as a team is going to utilize it. 
                So I can see some challenges when it comes to introducing newer people to this way of styling, aswell as how it can be timeconsuming setting it up, and mapping out the different parts of the design. 
                But it is very usefull in the longrun when there is a bigger project with a longterm goal that can afford the more expensive mapping.

                    <li>1. Improved Version: Include the improved individual version. Both link to live page and access to code.</li>
                        <p>
                            For the group assignment my main contribution was mainly on the earth. I animated the eyes, as well as drew the earth-patch in the middle and placed the text
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also mapped out where the different elements were in the html code to make it easier to understand what we were working on.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Main changes in the improved version is that I removed unnessesary elements, and grouped the elements with 
                            significant names, as well as simplified the elements in illustrator to make the elements less expensive
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the elements I transfered as SVGs into a folder named SVG in assets for more readable code. 
                            The elements I transfered were static elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I focused on improving the responsiveness on the page, as well as readability of the code and making the SVG's more simplified.
